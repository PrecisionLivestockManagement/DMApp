# DMMongoDB

A package to enable interactions with the DataMuster cattle database via the website app.

To download the package firstly install the devtools package and then run:

install_github("PrecisionLivestockManagement/DMApp")

The functions provide access to specific cattle data and the help files provide details on the what each of the functions can do. This is an ongoing project and is specifically focussed on researchers, data analysts and partners of DataMuster and is focussed on their specific needs. If there are new opportunities for standard data processing tools based on the DataMuster outputs from this package we are keen to integrate them as tools for further development.
